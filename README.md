# proxy-profiler [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

`ProxyProfiler` is a personal project that I started to study [AOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming). Developing the code, I decided to include [Expression Trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expression-tree/) for the purpose of study too. This quickly became a reasonable tool and I decided to make it a GitHub project.

You can use it as you like, respecting MIT license.

`ProxyProfiler` just keeps track of methods execution count, date and time of execution, arguments supplied to method and arguments after method execution and miliseconds elapsed to complete execution.

For more information, look at [Wiki](https://github.com/diteix/proxy-profiler/wiki)!
